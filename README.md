Do you ever want to listen to music that is explicitly on one platform, then follow it up with another form of media strictly on one website? Well, on lsmp we take all your favorite media and put it on one site!

### Getting Started
Checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/multiojuice/lsmp.git
> cd lsmp
> npm install
> npm start
```
Then visit localhost:8080 and start listing out your favorite media... or maybe even make some changes and send them in!
